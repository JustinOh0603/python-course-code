# Weather data exploration project

## This is a markdown file

You can type in markdown files which are common substitutes to plain text files as they contain some formatting. 

Here are some common markdown tricks.

To create different headings, please use "#", "##", and "###" to register different levels. 

Bullet points and number points both work in markdown files. Please remember the use of tab to register levels for them. You can also create checkboxes by using the series of characters "[ ]" at the beginning of a line.

To write code in your markdown, surround the code with  "\`" for inline code, such as `this is an inline code` or "```" for multiple lines of code. 

You can designate the coding language for code by adding the language name after the "```". For example:

```python
print("This is python")
```

Lastly, you can avoid including special characters by adding backslash before the characters, such as adding "\" before "`" would render it as a normal character.

## Requirements for this project

1. Setting up:
    1. Create a github repo to host your code
    2. Use a virtual environment for better compartmentalization of the code
2. Data analysis:
    1. Load data using APIs or provided CSVs
    2. Load and install packages useful for the project
    3. conduct data analysis using a Python Notebook
        1. Data cleaning
        2. Data analysis
        3. Data visualization
        4. Data modeling (prediction)
3. Model construction:
    1. Create a Python script with classes that will predict the weather or generate visualization based on any weather data input from the website
        1. Load data and preprocessing
        2. Load/generate model based on the data
        3. Predict/visualize the data
        4. Output results
        5. Programming best practices
4. Programming Practices
    1. Use git add/git commit/git push flow to log progress
    2. Use pip freeze > requirements.txt to save virtual environment package 
    3. Use .gitignore to avoid uploading package data on github
    4. Write [README.md](http://README.md) markdown for future readers to understand the code
